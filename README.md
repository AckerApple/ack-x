# ack-x, the Acker way of fullfilling our everyday Javascript needs
Extra functional library to objectify & compartmentalize variables into wrappers that make invokation & injection processes, lighter & easier to implement.

This code was born out of countless past production projects that were implemented and glued together by Acker Apple. This code is used in existing production projects and is still primarly maintained by Acker Apple.

At this time, the documentation is just now evolving as this package is just now becoming a publically consumable software. The demand for this code, as a public package, has out weighed producing proper documentation.


Use at will, use with caution. Perhaps, at best, we could learn something from this functional library.
